Read-Video

Generally we would see many video related to swimming and swimming competitions. Persons who know swimming and different swimming styles can understand what style it is as soon as they see a swimming video. But a lament cannot understand what swimming style it is as soon as they see a swimming video. That is the main motiviation for our project.

**Goal:**
The main idea of the project is to predict the swimming styles in the given swimming video and display the name of the pattern on the UI for the user to understand the video.
